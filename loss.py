# Implementation of loss terms for SRGAN as defined in https://arxiv.org/pdf/1609.04802.pdf


class ContentLoss(nn.Module):
    # Instead of relying on pixel-wise MSE loss for content loss, the designers
    # of SRGAN defined a new term called VGG loss. This is obtained by taking
    # the euclidean distance between the feature representation of the reference image and
    # the reconstructed image (which is found by taking the feature map obtained in
    # the j-th convolution, after activation and before the i-th maxpooling layer, of
    # the pre-trained VGG19 network).

        # the last convolution in VGG19. Other options we could use are: 4, 9, 18, 27.
